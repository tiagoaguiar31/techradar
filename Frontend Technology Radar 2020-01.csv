Biotope Quality Gate,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>Biotope Quality Gate is a plugin for Biotope that is used for linting and which enforces a quality standard across the project. By using BQG we would benefit by having a common project standard which reduces error proneness and time needed for code reviews.</p>"
Test Driven Development (TDD),Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>TDD is the practise of writing tests before or alongside the writing of actual code which enables you to write your code in a more structured manner and also see bugs immediately upon changing the code. TDD would benefit us greatly by reducing error proneness.</p>"
Biotope Sketcher,Tools,Trial,TRUE,"<p>Biotope Sketcher generates sketch files from existing design systems (frontend code), which designers could then use for further adjusting the designs of components. This would benefit us by enforcing a "one way direction of truth". When DEVs update the code, the design files automatically get updates as well.</p>"
Jest Testing Framework,languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p>Jest is an open source Javascript testing framework focusing on simplicity. It works out of the box, is mostly config-free and does not require additional assertion libraries. Jest is used by Facebook for react, but can be used for any JavaScript, Typescript or Nodejs project.</p><p>With Jest itâ€™s easier and faster to write tests than with Mocha and Chai.<p>We could profit from reduced efforts in setting-up and maintaining the testing framework and more efficiently writing tests.</p><p>Jest already is used and proven beneficial in existing VI projects like Neoperl.</p>"
