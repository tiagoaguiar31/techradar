Biotope Sketcher,Tools,Trial,TRUE,"<p>Biotope Sketcher generates sketch files from existing design systems (frontend code), which designers could then use for further adjusting the designs of components. This would benefit us by enforcing a "one way direction of truth". When DEVs update the code, the design files automatically get updates as well.</p>"
